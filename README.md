It'd be great if you link back to this GitHub if you plan to use heaps of code for your game!

## Notes for development in the game;
**> When scripting UIs;**
\- When UI is toggled;
\- if closed, have all events disconnected and frames destroyed.
\- if opened, have all events reconnect and frames recreated.

\- Extra Information;
\- use the "EmptyWidget.lua" in StarterPlayerScripts -> Core -> Widgets -> EmptyWidget.lua

**> Keep everything organized.**
\- follow what i have been doing with organization

*This will be using my framework, however, you can opt-in to fork the project and port it to your own*

Note: ***USE ROJO VERSION 7!!***  
`dev` is pushed to the staging game
`live` is pushed to the live game (only owner has access to this)

*If you are providing code contributions that require models to be added to the game,
include it in the "IMPORT" folder on your branch and place them in folders respective to 
where you need them added (eg; ReplicatedStorage, ServerStorage, StarterPlayerScripts)*.
